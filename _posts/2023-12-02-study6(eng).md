Hello, I'm Jihoon.<br>Today, we're going to take a look at **Selenium**, one of the web crawling and web automation tools. You can use Selenium to automatically control your web browser and collect data to increase work efficiency.

## What is "Selenium"?
Selenium is a web automation tool that automatically controls various web browsers. It was mainly developed for web test automation, but it is also utilized in web crawling. Selenium supports multiple languages, but I'll use Python to see what Selenium does.

## Selenium Installation and Configuration Settings
First, you must install Selenium. You can easily install it on the terminal using the commands below.
```
pip install selenium
```
Then, download [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) to control your Chrome browser and install it in the appropriate location.

## Basic instructions
Let's use Selenium to open a simple web page and look at the example code for manipulating elements.
```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

# Chrome 드라이버 경로 설정
chrome_driver_path = "경로/크롬드라이버.exe"
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=chrome_driver_path)

# 웹 페이지 열기
driver.get("https://www.example.com")

# 웹 페이지 타이틀 출력
print("웹 페이지 타이틀:", driver.title)

# 검색 창에 "Selenium" 입력 후 엔터
search_box = driver.find_element("name", "q")
search_box.send_keys("Selenium")
search_box.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)

# 브라우저 종료
driver.quit()
```

## How to use various features
1. **Finding Elements**
Selenium allows you to find elements on web pages in a variety of ways. You can use the `find_element` or `find_elements` method to find an element with a variety of selectors.
```python
# ID로 요소 찾기
element_by_id = driver.find_element("id", "myElement")

# 클래스 이름으로 요소 찾기
elements_by_class = driver.find_elements("class name", "myClass")
```

2. **Wait for Page**
It is important to wait for the web page to load completely. You can use `WebDriverWait` to wait for certain conditions to be met.
```python
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
	EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "myElement"))
)
```

3. **Screenshot Capture**
You can capture screenshots of web pages for error debugging or checking results.
```python
driver.save_screenshot("screenshot.png")
```

## Precautions and ethical use
It is recommended that you observe the Robots.txt standard when scrolling the web, check the policy and use the appropriate delay, as it may load the server. In addition, you should check the website's terms and conditions to see if crawling is allowed.

## Example of Excel Business Automation
```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import openpyxl

# Chrome 드라이버 경로 설정
chrome_driver_path = "경로/크롬드라이버.exe"
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=chrome_driver_path)

# 엑셀 파일 열기
workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook('data.xlsx')
sheet = workbook.active

# 각 행을 반복하며 데이터 읽어오기
for row in sheet.iter_rows(min_row=2, values_only=True):
	username, password = row

	# 웹 페이지 열기
	driver.get("https://example.com/login")

	# 로그인 폼 입력
	username_input = driver.find_element("id", "username")
	password_input = driver.find_element("id", "password")

	username_input.send_keys(username)
	password_input.send_keys(password)

	# 로그인 버튼 클릭
	login_button = driver.find_element("xpath", "//button[@type='submit']")
	login_button.click()

# 브라우저 종료
driver.quit()
```
This code is a simple example of reading each line's username and password from an Excel file (`data.xlsx`), entering it into the web page's login form, and logging in. You'll need to add more features to implement in real life. This way, Selenium can help you get more efficient.
