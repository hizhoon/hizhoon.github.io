Hello, I'm Jihoon.<br>Today, I'm going to find out about TensorFlow related to deep learning.

## TensorFlow Introduction
TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning and deep learning framework developed by Google, which was first unveiled in 2015. Available in multiple languages, it is primarily used through APIs based on Python. TensorFlow performs numerical operations through computational graphs, and it offers many features for building and training deep learning models.

## Key Features of TensorFlow
1. **Computation Graph**
<br>TensorFlow graphically represents the computational process. It is a graph structure in which operation nodes are edge-connected, and the operation flow of the model can be clearly visualized.

2. **Support for a wide range of platforms**
<br>TensorFlow can run on a variety of platforms. It can deploy and run models on desktops, servers, mobile devices, browsers, etc. for a wide range of applications.

3. **Auto Differentiation**
<br>Differentiation is done automatically, making it convenient to calculate gradients. This is mainly used during the training phase of the model and used to optimize weight updates.

4. **TensorFlow Extended (TFX)**
<br>TFX is an extension of TensorFlow, which is used to manage the entire machine learning pipeline from development to deployment of models.

## Major modules in the TensorFlow
1. **TensorFlow.keras**
<br>Keras is a high-level API of TensorFlow that helps you quickly and easily build deep learning models.

2. **TensorFlow Hub**
<br>Pre-trained models and libraries used to inflate models. Pre-trained models for different domains are available.

3. **TensorFlow Lite**
<br>A lightweight library for deploying the TensorFlow model on mobile and embedded devices.

## Use of TensorFlow
-   Image classification and object detection
-   Natural language processing (translation, emotion analysis, etc.)
-   Voice recognition and synthesis
-   Development of game artificial intelligence
-   the field of scientific research and healthcare

## TensorFlow Example Code
An example of creating a simple linear regression model and implementing the process of learning and predicting data with TensorFlow.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create virtual linear data
np.random.seed(0)
X_train = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
y_train = 2 * X_train + 1 + 0.1 * np.random.randn(100)

# Implementing a Linear Regression Model with TensorFlow
class LinearRegressionModel(tf.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.W = tf.Variable(5.0)
        self.b = tf.Variable(0.0)

    def __call__(self, x):
        return self.W * x + self.b

# Definition of loss function (means squared error)
def loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))

# Optimizer Settings
learning_rate = 0.01
optimizer = tf.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate)

# Create a model
model = LinearRegressionModel()

# Defining Learning Functions
def train_step(inputs, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(inputs)
        current_loss = loss(labels, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(current_loss, [model.W, model.b])
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, [model.W, model.b]))
    return current_loss

# learning progression
epochs = 1000
for epoch in range(epochs):
    current_loss = train_step(X_train, y_train)

    if epoch % 100 == 0:
        print(f"Epoch {epoch}: Loss: {current_loss.numpy()}")

# Prediction with learned models
X_test = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
y_pred = model(X_test)

# Visualization
plt.scatter(X_train, y_train, label="Training Data")
plt.plot(X_test, y_pred, color='red', linewidth=3, label="Predictions")
plt.xlabel("X")
plt.ylabel("y")
plt.title("Linear Regression with TensorFlow")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
This code is an example of learning a simple linear regression model using TensorFlow. You can see that running the code reduces the loss for each epoxy. Use the last learned model to visualize a prediction for a given input.

This example allows you to learn the basic flow of defining and learning the model with TensorFlow.
